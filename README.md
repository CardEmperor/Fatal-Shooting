# Fatal-Shooting

On average, police in the United States shoot and kill more than 1,000 people every year, according to an ongoing analysis by The Washington Post.

This database contains records of every person shot by an on-duty police officer since Jan. 1, 2015, as well as the agencies involved in each event. It is updated regularly as fatal shootings are reported and as facts emerge about individual cases.

I have built a hypothesis to understand the gun laws in US which fails to restrict children to procure weapons and for that I sourced the fatal police shooting datasets and explored through visualizations and some statistical tests and concluded with an ML algorithm for threat prediction for US police force.

We have analysed data till 2022 and would like you to review it.
